                        <h1> About Me </h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am currently in my second year at the University of Western Ontario, pursuing a Computer Engineering and Honours Business Administration Dual Degree with the Ivey Business School. I am a National President's Scholar and hold a 94% cumulative weighted average.</p>
                        <p>I will be working as a software developer co-op at Magnet Forensics for summer 2017! Previously, I have worked in a research lab within a group exploring a wide variety of technological fields including adaptive wireless systems and networks, and emerging communications/computing technologies and applications. I have authored two conference publications relating to my research. In addition to technology roles, I would still like to further explore my interests in consulting, finance, and entrepreneurship. </p>
                        <p>As a strong believer in volunteerism and community service, I am involved with initiatives including the Thames Valley Science and Engineering Fair, Western Student Research Conference, and the Western Founders Network Education Portfolio. All of these initiatives serve to engage youth and future generations by providing avenues and opportunities for personal development. 
                        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, and playing and watching sports, particularly hockey and golf. I also like to use my time for DIY home/room improvement projects and of course learning and developing with new technologies. My reading interests include biographies and sabremetrics discussions while viewing interests range from mystery thrillers to animated comedies.</p>
